University Spend Analysis and Dashboards using three different BI Applications
Project Overview
#The idea for the project came from one of the BIG10 Universities which is looking into purchasing a more sophisticated BI platform. The University is currently using Tableau as their go to BI tool, but is open to other options. Our Team decided to utilize the knowledge learned during a 6 month program in order to research & explore at least 3 different BI tools. Two of the BI tools are leaders in the BI market. The other BI application is not so popular.

Tools Used
#1.Excel Macros #2.JavaScript #3.Jupyter Notebook (*20K rows limit) #4.Pandas #5.Python #6.Postgres #7.Dundas BI #8.Microsoft Power BI #9.Tableau #10.Zepl (*Maximum file size is 20MB)

conclusion
#Based on our hands-on experience, we concluded that each and every tool that we worked on is capable of delivering the expected results. However, the flexibility of the BI application determines the extent of customization of users’ needs. #We found that Tableau is somewhat limited; not as flexible as both Microsoft Power BI and Dundas BI. #Dundas BI software is a comprehensive BI tool that can be accessed via any browser. It offers customization features for reporting and dashboards. Although, it requires some programing knowledge, it’s flexible and easy to use. #Overall, Power BI is a great tool for doing data analysis. The pros outweigh the cons. Anyone who does pivot tables, charts, and simple formulas in Excel can start using Power BI to quickly turn data into visuals.
